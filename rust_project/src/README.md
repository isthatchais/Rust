# Overview

This is my first attempt to learn Rust.  I think I may have bitten off more than I could chew

I wrote part of a program to create a student class then a course class and implemtent them together 

My purpose was to gain some experience with Rust and I did, I just need to spend more time with it.

Here is a video of me running the software I developed.
